# Movie-Correlation-Project
**Project Overview**

This project analyzes a movie dataset to explore how different features — such as budget, gross revenue, votes, and ratings — are related.
The goal is to identify the strongest correlations and understand which factors contribute most to a movie’s financial success.

The analysis was done using Python in Anaconda Jupyter Notebook.

**Objectives**

Explore and clean movie dataset.

Find correlations between key variables such as budget, gross, rating, and votes.

Visualize relationships using scatter plots and heatmaps.

Interpret insights from the correlation matrix.

**Dataset**

File Name: movies.csv
Source: Open dataset from Kaggle
 (Movie Industry Data).

**Key Columns:**

name — Movie title

rating — IMDB rating

genre — Movie genre

year — Release year

budget — Movie budget (in $)

gross — Gross revenue (in $)

votes — Number of audience votes

company — Production company

**Tools & Libraries**

Anaconda Jupyter Notebook

Python 3

**Libraries used:**

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

**Research Questions**

Does a higher budget lead to higher gross revenue?

Is there a strong relationship between IMDB ratings and gross revenue?

Do the number of votes indicate popularity and success?

Which features are most correlated with each other?

**Analysis & Visualizations**

Cleaning and formatting data using Pandas

Scatter plot: Budget vs. Gross Revenue

Correlation Matrix for numeric columns

Heatmap to visualize strong and weak correlations

Sorting correlation pairs to identify top relationships

**Key Insights**

1️⃣ A strong positive correlation exists between budget and gross revenue — higher budgets generally yield higher returns.
2️⃣ The number of votes is also positively correlated with both ratings and gross revenue, indicating audience engagement drives success.
3️⃣ Ratings show a moderate correlation with revenue — good movies tend to perform well, but not always.
4️⃣ Data visualization helps clearly highlight financial and audience-driven success factors in the film industry.

**Conclusion**

The project demonstrates that financial investment and audience engagement are key drivers of movie success.
By analyzing correlations among movie attributes, we can better understand which factors predict strong box office performance.
